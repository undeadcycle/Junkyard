# act as an expert in python and help me plan out a script for scraping websites to gather information about what is going on in chattanooga TN today and soon. 
- what websites should we scrape?

    - https://chattanoogachamber.com/

    - https://www.chattlibrary.org/events/

these are just possible suggestions and may need modified to find the correct page or pages for each site.

- what functions we should think about?

    - pull information: multiple steps per site? if so what are the steps?

    - clean information: different for each site?

    - filter information: what info is relevant and sort by date. different date formats per site?

    - format information for human consumption: combine all sites, filter by date and or activity type

    - send information: email? other options?

    - what are the options for tools: beautiful soup? html2text? mistune? others?

did i miss anything?

You've outlined a solid plan for scraping event information from various Chattanooga websites. Let's break down the process and discuss the components you've mentioned:

Websites to scrape:
Your list of websites looks comprehensive. We'll need to analyze each site's structure to determine the best approach for scraping.
Functions to consider:

a. Fetching data:

    - fetch_page(url): Retrieve the HTML content of a page
    - parse_html(html_content): Convert HTML to a parseable format

b. Extracting information:

    - extract_events(parsed_content, site_name): Extract event data from the parsed content

c. Cleaning and filtering:

    - lean_event_data(event_data): Standardize and clean the extracted data
    - filter_events(events, start_date, end_date): Filter events by date range

d. Formatting:

    - format_events(events): Prepare events for human-readable output

e. Sending information:

    - send_email(formatted_events, recipient): Send the formatted events via email


Tools:


    - Beautiful Soup: Excellent for parsing HTML and XML
    - Requests: For making HTTP requests
    - dateutil: For parsing and manipulating dates
    - pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
    - email: For sending emails


Steps for each website:

    a. Fetch the page
    b. Parse the HTML
    c. Extract event information
    d. Clean and standardize the data
    e. Store in a common format (e.g., a list of dictionaries)

Data cleaning and standardization:


    - Standardize date formats
    - Remove HTML tags from descriptions
    - Normalize venue names and addresses


Filtering:


    - Filter by date range
    - Optionally filter by event type or category


Formatting for human consumption:


    - Sort events by date
    - Group by day or week
    - Include relevant details (title, date, time, venue, description)


Sending information:


    - Email is a good option
    - You could also consider generating a PDF report or updating a web page

Additional considerations:

    - Error handling: Implement try-except blocks to handle potential issues
    - Rate limiting: Respect websites' robots.txt and implement delays between requests
    - Caching: Store fetched data to reduce load on target websites
    - Logging: Implement logging to track the scraping process and any issues
    - Scheduling: Set up the script to run automatically at regular intervals
